# Pascal-Compiler

This is an implementation of a Pascal compiler using Java made by:

Gabriel Soares, Marco Oliari and Sophie Dilhon

In this stage of the project, the semantic analyser was implemented, along with an AST and some auxiliar tables to store, for example, variables and functions. 

## How to run
To compile and run the code, you can run in your command line:
```sh
make all
make runall
```

The output and the dot files will be located in a directory called `out`.
