# Pascal-Compiler

This is an implementation of a Pascal compiler using Java made by:

Gabriel Soares, Marco Oliari and Sophie Dilhon

In this stage of the project, the compiler generates JVM (bytecode) based on the AST implemented in a prior stage.

## How to run
To compile and run the code, you can run in your command line:
```sh
make all
make runall
```

The output and the dot files will be located in a directory called `out`.
